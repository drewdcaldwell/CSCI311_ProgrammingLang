A Programming Language is a notation for describing Algorithm and Data.
A Program is a sentence of a programming language.

    Class{
        -> Method{
                ->Statement{}}}

A Program may perform one task.

Programming Languages:

1.) High Level Languages: The compiler is involved. Designed to be readible, so that it is similar
to human language. Such as C++/Python, Java, C.

2.) Mid Level Languages: The assembler is involved. mnemonics

3.) Low Level Languages: Binary Code

FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator)
- Created in 1954
- The first high level language
- Developed by using the first compiler ever made.
- Machine independent
- In 1958 introduced subroutines, functions, loops, and primitive for loops.

LISP (LISt Processing)
- Created in 1958 and released in 1960
- Lisp was intended for writing AI programs
- It uses Atoms and List as a data structure:
-> Atom: Numeric, 1, 2, 3, ... 
         Symbolic, "Book", etc.
-> Lists: (This is a list of 7 atoms)

(This is a list)

     00
       \
        00
       /   \
    This    00
           /  \
        is     00
              /  \
            a     0(lambda) 
                 / 
               list

EX: ( * (+ 1 2)(-7 3))




    







_ Fuctional Programming Style: all component computation is performed by applying
functions to arguments variable declaration are rarely used.

- A Reliance on Recursion: a strong Reliance on Recursion
has allowed LISP to be successful in many areas, including AI.

- Garbage collection: LISP has built-in garbage collection, so programmers
do not need to explicitly free dynamically allocated memory.

Propostional Logic: 
Every Man is immortal,
Socratees is a man,
-> Therefore, Socrates is immortal.

COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language)
- The CODASYL( COnference on Data SYstems Languages)
worked from May 1959 to April 1960
- Object Oriented version of COBOL was introduced in 1997
- Introduced the Record Data Structure.
- (There are different Divisions in COBOL)
    - Identification: Information about the code (date, author,...)
    - Environment
    - Data
    - Procedure: Where the logic and code is written.


ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language)
- It was released in 1960 
- It was the first Block Structured Language.
    An example of a Block Structure is a main method in Java,
    we may have multiple blocks to run different tasks.

- Considered to be the first second generation Computer Language.
- Machine indepenedent language.

Scope of a variable:

    public class Scope{
        public static void main(String() args){
            double r;
            r = 3.14;
        }
        System.out.println(r);
    }

Backus Naur Form (BNF)

< symbols ) := exp1|exp2|...|expu
Non-terminal     terminal/nonterminal

nonterminals -> Terminals

Example:    S-> aBa
            B-> bB|e
            A-> a|b

S -> aBa -> aA ->ab
